    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>500g bread flour</li>
      <li>100g whole wheat flour</li>
      <li>350ml warm water</li>
      <li>100g sourdough starter (active)</li>
      <li>10g salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon honey (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the bread flour, whole wheat flour, and salt.</li>
      <li>Mix in the warm water, sourdough starter, and honey (if using). Stir until the dough comes together.</li>
      <li>Knead the dough for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. You can do this by hand or with a stand mixer.</li>
      <li>Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>After resting, knead the dough for an additional 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Let the dough rise in the bowl for about 4-6 hours at room temperature, or until doubled in size. You can also do an overnight rise in the refrigerator for a more developed flavor.</li>
      <li>Once risen, gently shape the dough into a round or oval loaf and place it on a floured surface or in a proofing basket.</li>
      <li>Let the dough rise again for 2-3 hours, or until it has puffed up significantly.</li>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 230°C (450°F). If you have a Dutch oven, preheat it as well.</li>
      <li>Score the top of the dough with a sharp knife to help it expand during baking.</li>
      <li>Bake the bread in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. If using a Dutch oven, bake for 20 minutes with the lid on, then remove the lid for the remaining time.</li>
      <li>Allow the bread to cool on a rack before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
